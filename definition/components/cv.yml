      - h5: About me
      - p: |
          At my beginnings by 2005, I started with Visual Basic 6.0 where I learned the programming basics
          and I began loving to code, made a couple of systems, then I moved on into a more serious language,
          Java. I learned how to program object-oriented and reinforced my knowledge by taking some courses
          at Educacion IT.

          <br /><br />Some friends and I made our own Company called Inspiracode, we did it for about 4 years,
          and we got failures and successes with several customers and the learning was of multple kinds of
          aspects, from requirements gathering, deployments to windows/linux, our first SPA framework EnyoJS
          (from HP) by 2013, Enterprise applications with J2EE, source control with git, and many other
          things that I don't even remember.

          <br /><br />Capsonic was my first employer as an official Software Developer, and this time I had
          to move to .Net technologies for Backend side, jQuery and AngularJS for FrontEnd side and Real Time
          with Web Sockets.

          <br /><br />Technology is growing rapidly and a programmer needs to be always up to date. It is a habit for me
          to spend one or two hours per day on learning new stuff regarding to code, technology and
          frameworks. I've been doing apps or tools to help me out in almost all my jobs, as well as making
          software independently on my free time.
